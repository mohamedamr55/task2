# LSTM Computation Example - New Approach

## Introduction
This project presents an alternative implementation of an LSTM cell computation using Python. The approach follows the standard LSTM process, computing forget gates, input gates, candidate values, cell state updates, and output gates to generate a final prediction.

## Project Structure
- `lstm_example_v4.py`: Python script performing LSTM calculations step-by-step.
- `README_v4.md`: Documentation explaining the logic and execution process.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy

## Running the Script
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install NumPy if necessary:
   ```sh
   pip install numpy
   ```
3. Execute the script:
   ```sh
   python lstm_example_v4.py
   ```

## Expected Output
The script will display the calculated hidden state and cell state for each step, followed by the final output prediction.
